G’day I'm Ed. I make stuff. Jokes, vlogs, websites, as well as things you can actually touch like bread and beer and Japanese food. I guess I make things either in jest or to ingest.

If and when people are allowed to sit in confined, dark, beer-soaked spaces I sometimes appear there to make them chuckle.

Should that sound like a thing you'd be into then follow me on Twitter you crazy thing.
