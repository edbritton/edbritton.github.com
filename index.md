G’day I'm Ed. I make stuff. Jokes, vlogs, websites, as well as things you can actually touch like bread and beer and Japanese food. I guess the only IRL stuff I make are things you can ingest.

There is a something I do which is kind of halfway between those – live stand-up comedy. It's a physical thing you have to leave the house to partake, plus your being there may even affect the end result!

If that sounds like a thing you'd be into then follow me on Twitter you crazy thing.
